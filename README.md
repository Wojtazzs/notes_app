# notes_server
This is my small personal project for note-taking. I got tired of bloated and slow apps for note-taking. I felt that the best app should be quick to access and write in, but most of them have 9000 features and are slow to sync, which is, in my opinion, the whole point, so I decided to create one myself. I chose Htmx and Rust Actix with MariaDB because I wanted to try them on a bigger project.

Everyone can use this code, but I wouldn't suggest it for safety and scalability concerns. It was meant to be for personal use only, but I decided to publish it if someone wants some inspiration.
